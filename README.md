# libaegis

Portable C implementations of the [AEGIS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-aegis-aead/) family of high-performance authenticated ciphers (AEGIS-128L, AEGIS-128X2, AEGIS-128X4, AEGIS-256, AEGIS-256X2, AEGIS-256X4), with runtime CPU detection.

## Features

- AEGIS-128X2 with 16 and 32 bytes tags (software, VAES + AVX2, AES-NI, ARM Crypto, Altivec)
- AEGIS-128X4 with 16 and 32 bytes tags (software, AVX512, VAES + AVX2, AES-NI, ARM Crypto, Altivec)
- AEGIS-256 with 16 and 32 bytes tags (software, AES-NI, ARM Crypto, Altivec)

- All variants of AEGIS-MAC, supporting incremental updates.
- Encryption and decryption with attached and detached tags
- Incremental encryption and decryption.
- Random-access encrypted file API (RAF) for building encrypted filesystems and databases.
- Unauthenticated encryption and decryption (not recommended - only implemented for specific protocols)
- Deterministic pseudorandom stream generation.

## Installation

Note that the compiler makes a difference. Zig (or a recent `clang` with target-specific options such as `-march=native`) produces more efficient code than `gcc`.

### Compilation with `zig`

```sh
zig build -Drelease
```

To build the library as a shared object using the `-Dlinkage` option:

```sh
zig build -Dlinkage=dynamic -Drelease
```

The library and headers are installed in the `zig-out` folder.

To favor performance over side-channel mitigations on devices without hardware acceleration, add `-Dfavor-performance`:

```sh
zig build -Drelease -Dfavor-performance
```

A benchmark can also be built with the `-Dwith-benchmark` option:

```sh
zig build -Drelease -Dfavor-performance -Dwith-benchmark
```

`libaegis` doesn't need WASI nor any extension to work on WebAssembly. The `wasm32-freestanding` target is fully supported.

WebAssembly extensions such as `bulk_memory` and `simd128` can be enabled by adding `-Dcpu=baseline+bulk_memory+simd128` to the command line.

### Compilation with `cmake`

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/prefix ..
make install
```

To build the library as a shared library, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=On`.

To favor performance over side-channel mitigations on devices without hardware acceleration, add `-DFAVOR_PERFORMANCE`.

### Direct inclusion

Copy everything in `src` directly into your project, and compile everything like regular C code. No special configuration is required.

## Usage

Include `<aegis.h>` and call `aegis_init()` prior to doing anything else with the library.

`aegis_init()` checks the CPU capabilities in order to later use the fastest implementations.

### Random-Access File API

The RAF (Random-Access File) API lets you work with encrypted files as naturally as regular files. Read any byte range, write anywhere, extend or truncate at will, all with full encryption and authentication. Files can be arbitrarily large without ever loading them entirely into memory. This makes it straightforward to build encrypted filesystems, databases, or any application that needs to modify encrypted data in place without re-encrypting the entire file.

```c
#include <aegis.h>

// Allocate scratch buffer (can be stack, heap, or static)
CRYPTO_ALIGN(64) uint8_t scratch_buf[AEGIS128L_RAF_SCRATCH_SIZE(4096)];
aegis_raf_scratch scratch = { .buf = scratch_buf, .len = sizeof scratch_buf };

aegis128l_raf_ctx ctx;
aegis_raf_config cfg = { .scratch = &scratch, .chunk_size = 4096, .flags = AEGIS_RAF_CREATE };
aegis_raf_io io = { /* your I/O callbacks */ };
aegis_raf_rng rng = { /* your RNG callback */ };

aegis128l_raf_create(&ctx, &io, &rng, &cfg, master_key);
aegis128l_raf_write(&ctx, &written, data, len, offset);
aegis128l_raf_read(&ctx, buf, &bytes_read, len, offset);
aegis128l_raf_close(&ctx);  // automatically calls sync
```

The API requires pluggable I/O (`read_at`, `write_at`, `get_size`, `set_size`, `sync`) and RNG callbacks, making it usable with any storage backend. Callers provide a scratch buffer for internal use, enabling zero-allocation operation.

#### Merkle tree integrity

RAF supports an optional Merkle tree that tracks per-chunk integrity. The tree is updated automatically on writes and truncations, and can be verified or rebuilt on demand. This is useful for detecting silent corruption or tampering without re-reading and re-encrypting every chunk.

Leaf values come from your `hash_leaf` callback over plaintext chunk data. They are not the RAF per-chunk AEAD authentication tags.
Keep leaf hashing stable by depending on `chunk`, `chunk_len`, and `chunk_idx`.

`aegis128l_raf_merkle_commitment()` returns a context-bound commitment that
includes the file's version, algorithm, chunk size, and identity alongside
the structural tree root and file size. This is the recommended API for
RAF files.

```c
// Provide hash callbacks and a caller-allocated buffer
aegis_raf_merkle_config merkle = {
    .hash_leaf       = my_hash_leaf,       // hash plaintext chunk data (not the RAF auth tag)
    .hash_parent     = my_hash_parent,     // combine two child digests
    .hash_empty      = my_hash_empty,      // digest for missing/empty nodes
    .hash_commitment = my_hash_commitment, // hash(root, ctx, file_size)
    .hash_len        = 32,                 // digest size (8..64 bytes)
    .max_chunks      = 1024,
    .buf             = merkle_buf,
    .len             = sizeof merkle_buf,
};

// Pass merkle config when creating the RAF context
aegis_raf_config cfg = {
    .scratch = &scratch, .chunk_size = 4096,
    .flags = AEGIS_RAF_CREATE, .merkle = &merkle,
};

// After writes, verify integrity or read the root commitment
aegis128l_raf_merkle_verify(&ctx, &corrupted_chunk);
uint8_t root[32];
aegis128l_raf_merkle_commitment(&ctx, root, sizeof root);
```

The tree uses a flat buffer layout with configurable hash callbacks, so it works with any hash function. `aegis_raf_merkle_buffer_size()` computes the required buffer size for a given `max_chunks` and `hash_len`.
